# Project-4

## Overview

This project is based on [Spotify data](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api). 

Songs will be clustered based on their characteristics via K-means, and the clustering will be used to generate music recommendations based on an input song. The goal is to provide 5-10 song recommendations of similar songs for any input. 

If time permits, we will further train a machine learning model to predict the popularity of an input song based on its characteristics.
